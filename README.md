Final Submission — SalesBets & NSBLPA Prototypes
===============================================

What’s included
---------------
- salesbets-prototype/  (index, ownership, teams, apps, contact, salesbets-athlete, css/, js/)
- nsblpa-prototype/    (index, ownership, teams, apps, contact, css/, js/)

How to run
----------
1. Unzip the package.
2. Open either `salesbets-prototype/index.html` or `nsblpa-prototype/index.html` in your browser (no server required).

Notes & Assumptions
-------------------
- Built with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JS (ES6). No build tools or frameworks required.
- Mobile-first, responsive design. Hamburger menu on small screens.
- Accessibility: semantic structure, `aria` attributes for menu, `alt` text replaced by initials/icons (no external logo assets required).
- Images/icons are implemented with CSS initials — no external assets needed. If you want real logos later, they can be swapped in.
- Contact form is mocked (no backend) — it shows an alert on submit.

If you want a live preview link (GitHub Pages or Netlify), I can deploy both folders and provide URLs.
